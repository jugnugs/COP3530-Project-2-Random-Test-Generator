# COP3530 Project 2 Random Test Generator
Generates a random graph according to the passed in vertice/edge/power iteration parameters and outputs a text file

## Usage
Assuming you have Python (3.6+) installed on your system and (optionally) a virtual environment set up:
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the required dependencies using: <br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script in random_graph.py using: <br>
` python random_graph.py <numVertices> <numEdges> <numPowerIterations>`
> Example: `python random_graph.py 100 200 2`
4. The resulting graph should be outputed to <i>results.txt</i>. You can directly paste its contents into your project's main program.
